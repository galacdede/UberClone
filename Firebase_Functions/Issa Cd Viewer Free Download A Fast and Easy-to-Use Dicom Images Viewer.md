## What are CD Images and Why Use Them
 
A CD image is a file that contains the exact copy of a CD or DVD. It can store the data, audio, video, and other information that is on the disc. A CD image can have different extensions, such as ISO, BIN, NRG, MDF, and IMG.
 
There are many reasons why you may want to use CD images instead of physical discs. Some of them are:

- You can save space and avoid cluttering your shelves with discs.
- You can protect your discs from scratches, damage, or loss.
- You can access your discs faster and easier from your computer.
- You can create backups of your discs and share them with others.
- You can run multiple discs at the same time without swapping them.

## What are Virtual Drives and How They Work
 
A virtual drive is a software that simulates a physical drive on your computer. It can create a virtual CD or DVD drive that can read CD images as if they were real discs. A virtual drive can have different letters, such as F:, G:, H:, etc.
 
To use a virtual drive, you need a software that can create and manage it. One of these software is Issa Cd Viewer, which can create up to four virtual drives on your computer. Issa Cd Viewer can also mount and unmount CD images on the virtual drives with just a few clicks.
 
When you mount a CD image on a virtual drive, you can access it from your file explorer or any other program that can read CDs. You can view the contents of the image, copy files, run programs, or play music or videos. When you unmount the image, the virtual drive becomes empty and ready for another image.
