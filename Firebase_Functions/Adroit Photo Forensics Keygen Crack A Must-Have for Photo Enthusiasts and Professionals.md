In this article, we will show you how to use Adroit Photo Forensics to recover deleted photos from a memory card. We will assume that you have already installed the software on your computer and have a valid license key.

## Step 1: Launch Adroit Photo Forensics
 
Double-click on the Adroit Photo Forensics icon on your desktop or start menu to launch the software. You will see a welcome screen where you can enter your case and examiner information. You can also choose the analysis options, such as which photo formats to search for and whether to hash the evidence or not. Click on "Next" when you are done.
 
## Step 2: Select Your Evidence Source
 
You will see a screen where you can select your evidence source. You can choose from hard drives, drive images, CD/DVDs, or flash memory. In this example, we will select flash memory and insert our memory card into our computer's card reader. The software will detect the card and display its details. Click on "Next" when you are ready.
 
## Step 3: Start The Scan
 
The software will start scanning your memory card for deleted photos. You will see a progress bar and a status message indicating how many photos have been found so far. The scan may take some time depending on the size and condition of your memory card. You can pause or stop the scan at any time by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
 
## Step 4: Review The Results
 
When the scan is complete, you will see a screen where you can review the results. The software will display all the recovered photos in thumbnails along with their metadata and content information. You can sort, filter, group, tag, or bookmark the photos according to your preferences. You can also view the photos in full-screen mode or zoom in on them for more details.
