Important notice! MultiScatterTexture is a tool that can work with any objects that are created using Vray and MentalRay rendering engines, except for one exception: MentalProxy objects. MentalProxy objects are not compatible with MultiScatterTexture because of the specific way that MentalRay is implemented for 3ds max software.
  
MultiScatterTexture is a plugin that allows you to create complex materials with multiple textures and colors. You can use it to create realistic effects such as grass, fur, hair, sand, snow and more. MultiScatterTexture can also generate random variations in the texture parameters, such as hue, saturation, brightness and rotation.

To use MultiScatterTexture, you need to have Vray or MentalRay installed as your renderer. You also need to create objects that are compatible with MultiScatterTexture, such as VrayProxy, VrayInstancer, VrayFur or MentalRay Scatter. These objects allow you to scatter millions of instances of a single object over a surface or a volume.
  
However, there is one type of object that is not compatible with MultiScatterTexture: MentalProxy. MentalProxy is a feature of MentalRay that allows you to load external geometry files at render time. Unlike VrayProxy, MentalProxy does not support custom attributes or user data channels, which are required by MultiScatterTexture to assign different textures and colors to each instance. Therefore, if you try to use MultiScatterTexture with MentalProxy objects, you will not get the desired result.
  
If you want to use MultiScatterTexture with your objects, you need to follow some steps. First, you need to create a MultiScatterTexture material and assign it to your object. Then, you need to add one or more textures to the MultiScatterTexture material and adjust their parameters. You can also use masks to control the distribution of the textures over the object. Finally, you need to enable the MultiScatterTexture option in the object's properties and specify the number of user data channels that you want to use.
  
MultiScatterTexture can help you create realistic and diverse materials for your scenes. However, it can also affect the rendering speed and memory usage of your system. To optimize the performance of MultiScatterTexture, you can try some tips. For example, you can reduce the number of textures and user data channels that you use, or use lower resolution textures and smaller bitmaps. You can also use proxies or instances instead of original geometry to save memory and speed up rendering.
  
MultiScatterTexture is a powerful and versatile plugin that can enhance your materials and scenes. You can use it to create various effects such as grass, fur, hair, sand, snow and more. You can also combine it with other plugins and features of Vray and MentalRay to achieve even more realistic results. For example, you can use VrayDisplacementMod or MentalRay Displace to add more detail and depth to your surfaces, or use VrayEnvironmentFog or MentalRay Volume to create atmospheric effects.
