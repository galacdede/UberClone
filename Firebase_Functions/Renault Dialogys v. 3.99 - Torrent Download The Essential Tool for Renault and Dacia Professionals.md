## What is a Torrent?
 
A torrent is a file that contains information about other files that are distributed over a peer-to-peer network. This means that instead of downloading files from a single server, you download them from multiple sources that have the same files. This makes the download faster and more reliable, as well as reduces the load on the original source. However, torrenting also has some risks, such as exposing your IP address to other users, downloading corrupted or infected files, or violating copyright laws. Therefore, you should always use a reputable torrent client, a VPN service, and an antivirus program when downloading torrents.
