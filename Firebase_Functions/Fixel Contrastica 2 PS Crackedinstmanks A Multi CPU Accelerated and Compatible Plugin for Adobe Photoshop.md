## How to Use Fixel Contrastica 2 PS
 
To use Fixel Contrastica 2 PS, you need to open an image in Photoshop and go to Filter > Fixel Algorithms > Fixel Contrastica 2 PS. This will open the plugin interface where you can adjust the settings.
 
The plugin interface has two main sections: Local Contrast and Global Contrast. Local contrast affects the contrast between neighboring pixels, while global contrast affects the contrast between the whole image. You can adjust both sections independently or together.
 
Each section has three sliders: Shadows, Midtones and Highlights. These sliders allow you to control the contrast priority for each tonal range. For example, if you want to enhance the contrast mainly in the shadows, you can increase the Shadows slider and decrease the other two sliders.
 
Each section also has a Resolution drop-down menu where you can choose from different presets for local contrast. The presets are based on the image resolution and affect the size of the local contrast regions. For example, if you have a high-resolution image, you can choose a higher resolution preset to avoid over-sharpening or halo effects.
 
Finally, each section has a Mode drop-down menu where you can choose between Normal and Preserve Saturation modes. Normal mode affects both luminosity and color channels, while Preserve Saturation mode affects only luminosity channel. Preserve Saturation mode can help you avoid color shifting or oversaturation when applying high contrast values.
 
### Example 1: Enhancing Local Contrast
 
In this example, we will use Fixel Contrastica 2 PS to enhance the local contrast of an image of a flower. Here is the original image:
 ![Original image of a flower](flower.jpg) 
To enhance the local contrast, we will use the following settings:
 
- Local Contrast: Resolution - High Definition (4K), Mode - Normal, Shadows - 0%, Midtones - 100%, Highlights - 0%
- Global Contrast: Resolution - None, Mode - Normal, Shadows - 0%, Midtones - 0%, Highlights - 0%

Here is the result:
 ![Image of a flower with enhanced local contrast](flower_local.jpg) 
As you can see, the image looks sharper and more detailed. The texture of the petals and the pollen are more visible. The local contrast enhancement also creates a subtle depth effect by making the foreground more prominent than the background.
 
### Example 2: Enhancing Global Contrast
 
In this example, we will use Fixel Contrastica 2 PS to enhance the global contrast of an image of a cityscape. Here is the original image:
 ![Original image of a cityscape](city.jpg) 
To enhance the global contrast, we will use the following settings:

- Local Contrast: Resolution - None, Mode - Normal, Shadows - 0%, Midtones - 0%, Highlights - 0% 8cf37b1e13
