## Step 7: Support the official releases of Metal Slug
 
While playing Metal Slug on your PC with an emulator is fun and convenient, it is not the same as playing the official releases of the game. Emulation is not a perfect process and it may have some glitches or errors that affect the gameplay. Moreover, emulation does not support the developers and publishers of the game who worked hard to create this masterpiece. If you want to show your appreciation and support for Metal Slug, you should buy the official releases of the game if they are available for your platform. You can find some of the official releases of Metal Slug on Steam, PlayStation Store, Xbox Live Arcade, Nintendo eShop, Google Play Store, and Apple App Store.
