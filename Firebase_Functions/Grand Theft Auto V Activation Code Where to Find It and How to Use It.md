If you want to play GTA V on your PC, you will need to purchase and activate the game using a Rockstar Activation Code. This code is a unique 16-digit alphanumeric code that verifies your ownership of the game and allows you to download and install it on your computer. There are different ways to get a Rockstar Activation Code for GTA V, depending on where you bought the game from.
 
## Buying GTA V from the Rockstar Store
 
The easiest way to get a Rockstar Activation Code for GTA V is to buy the game directly from the Rockstar Store.

The Rockstar Games Launcher is a desktop application that lets you access and manage your Rockstar Games library, including GTA V.
 
When you download and install the Rockstar Games Launcher, you will need to sign in with your Social Club account. This is a free online service that connects you with other players and provides you with various features such as online multiplayer, cloud saves, achievements, rewards, and more. If you don't have a Social Club account yet, you can create one for free on the Rockstar Games website.

You don't need to enter any activation code manually because it is already linked to your account.

Depending on where you bought the game from, you will receive your Rockstar Activation Code in different ways. For example, if you bought GTA V from Steam or Epic Games Store, you will find your code in your library or order history on their respective platforms. If you bought GTA V from Amazon or a physical store, you will find your code inside the game box or on a receipt.
